## Introduction
Hello,
My name is Oscar Brown. I'm finishing up 6 years in the army and looking forward to reintegrating myself into the IT field. I've alway been interested in Information Technology and the MSSA program provides a great opportunity for me to pursue a career in this field.


## Participation in the MSSA program
The Microsoft Software and Systems Academy is an intense 18-week course designed to train transitioning service members in highly valued IT skills and job placement strategies. The Cloud Application Development path trains students to utilize C# to build applications that function on a variety of devices using the Windows 10 OS. T-SQL Server Management concepts including database programming, data integration, and data manipulation is also taught to students. As a student I am responsible for creating a unique software application as a term project, researching discussion questions, leading in class labs to trouble shoot or create programs, and demonstrate knowledgeability in both C# and T-SQL by conducting white board exercises.

Twitters SVP recently said, “With the team structure the Roman legion created, they were able to dominate 500 years of history and create a distributed network that ruled the Western world. If you can create a similar structure, you can rule the world too.” I true truly believe in that concept. However, a team is only as good as it’s weakest link. This is the main reason I decided to created “Health Assess 360”. It is an assessment application designed to visually show an athlete how they are doing physically and mentally, and recommends feedback.

The overall idea is a health assess application with a GUI. Once the user opens the app the page will ask the user “What is your current energy level? Enter a number between 1 to 10 into the textbox (1 being low,5 being medium, 10 being max).” Second the user is asked “What is your current Soreness level? Enter a number between 1 to 10 into the textbox (1 being little,5 being average, 10 being high).”  Third user is asked “How much sleep did you get last night? Enter a number between 1 to 10 into the textbox (1 being bad,5 being average, 10 being good).” Fourth the user is asked “What is your current Stress level? Enter a number between 1 to 10 into the textbox (1 being bad,5 being average, 10 being excellent).” The last prompt will ask the user to answer “how they performed today? (on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being bad, 5 being average, 10 being the best.” Upon answering all the Five questions, depending on the answers the user submits the application will return an appraisal or a suggestion of actions that can be taken to improve health. This tool can be used before and after performance. Information being submitted will be saved in a database to measure how an athlete’s health is affecting their performance. Total cumulation of data will be available daily and weekly for the coach or athlete to review. This will allow the coach or athlete to evaluate and modify training plans effectively.
