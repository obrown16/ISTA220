## Introduction

Hello and welcome! My name is Oscar Brown. I've been in the Army over six years. Currently working hard on the MSSA coursework and enjoying every challenging moment because I believe it will help me grow.

## About Project

The project idea I chose is a health assessment tool or “Health Assess 360”. There are many factors that affects an athlete’s performance weather it’s at training, practice or game situation. Primary factors are energy level, sleep, soreness level, and stress level. I believe that athletes can use this tool to assess how these factors are affecting their performance and coaches can make better informed decisions during practices or game situations.
