Read Chapter 6, pages 127 to 150 in the C# Step by Step book.

Discussion Questions:

1. An exception helps you deal with any unexpected or exceptional situations that occur when a program is running.

2. If the program executes without errors the try block if none of the statements generates an except it runs without the exception.

3. Immediately after the try block, the catch mechanism handles any possible error condition. It is intended to capture and handle a specific type of exception.

4. If an exception block fails to handle a particular error it terminates.

5. The parent class for all exceptions is system exception.

6. You determine the type of an error by using GetType method. (pg 132)

7. The purpose of integer check is to prevent the compiler from overflowing silently and generating the wrong answer when the values calculated exceed the allowed amount for a data type. pg 139

8. The finally block ensures that a statement always runs, whether or not an exception has been thrown.
